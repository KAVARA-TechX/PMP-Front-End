						items visitors are likely to click on most, the way
						visitors are clicking through the site, how many
						visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how
						long visitors to the site are staying and how often they
						are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with
						our servers and lets us better administer our systems.
						Although such information does not identify any visitor
						personally, it is possible to determine from an IP
						address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and
						the approximate geographic location of his or her point
						of connectivity.
